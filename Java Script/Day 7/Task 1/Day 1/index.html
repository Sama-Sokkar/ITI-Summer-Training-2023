        <h1 id="about">About Egypt</h1> <hr>
        <div>
            <p class="egy" >Egypt, a land of timeless mystique and historical grandeur, sits at the crossroads of civilizations, bearing witness to a legacy that stretches across millennia. Nestled in northeastern Africa, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the east, Egypt's imposing presence on the world stage is epitomized by its iconic pyramids that rise proudly from the golden sands of the Sahara Desert. These colossal architectural marvels, constructed by the ingenious hands of ancient Egyptians, embody both the incredible engineering prowess and the profound spiritual beliefs of a civilization that defied the limitations of its time.</p>
            <p class="egy">Amidst this rich tapestry of antiquity, Egypt's bustling cities pulse with a vibrant energy. Cairo, a metropolis of contrasts, seamlessly blends medieval mosques and bazaars with modern skyscrapers and bustling markets. The Egyptian Museum in Cairo houses an unparalleled collection of artifacts, including the treasures of Tutankhamun, allowing visitors to trace the threads of history that have shaped the nation. The tranquil banks of the Nile remain a lifeline of transportation, commerce, and cultural exchange, where traditional feluccas and luxury cruisers share the waters.</p>
            <p class="egy">Egypt's allure extends beyond its historical marvels to its warm and resilient people. Their deep-rooted traditions, expressed through art, music, and cuisine, create a cultural kaleidoscope that reflects the nation's diverse heritage. The echoes of ancient religious beliefs resound through the calls to prayer and the spiritual devotion of both Muslims and Coptic Christians.</p>
            <p class="egy">As the sun sets over the desert landscapes, painting the horizon with hues of gold and crimson, Egypt's magic becomes even more palpable. The timeless sands of the Sahara, the serene waters of the Red Sea, and the vibrant coral reefs of the Sinai Peninsula offer diverse landscapes for exploration and adventure. Egypt's modern aspirations are visible in its growing economy and efforts toward sustainable development, aiming to harmonize progress with the preservation of its precious historical legacy.</p>
            <p class="egy">Traveling through Egypt is an exploration of living history. Luxor, with its ethereal temples and colossal statues, stands as a testament to the extraordinary architectural achievements of the past. The Temples of Karnak and Luxor, each a symphony of colossal columns, intricate reliefs, and sacred sanctuaries, offer glimpses into the spiritual and ceremonial practices of ancient Egyptians. The Valley of the Kings, where elaborately adorned tombs house the remains of pharaohs and nobles, preserves not just bodies, but stories of an afterlife filled with magic and wonder.</p>
            <p class="egy">Modern Egypt dates back to 1922, when it gained independence from the British Empire as a monarchy. Following the 1952 revolution, Egypt declared itself a republic, and in 1958 it merged with Syria to form the United Arab Republic, which dissolved in 1961. Throughout the second half of the 20th century, Egypt endured social and religious strife and political instability, fighting several armed conflicts with Israel in 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973, and occupying the Gaza Strip intermittently until 1967. In 1978, Egypt signed the Camp David Accords, officially withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and recognising Israel. After the Arab Spring, which led to the 2011 Egyptian revolution and overthrow of Hosni Mubarak, the country faced a protracted period of political unrest. Egypt's current government, a semi-presidential republic led by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi since 2014, has been described by a number of watchdogs as authoritarian and responsible for perpetuating the country's poor human rights record.</p>
            <p class="egy">Islam is the official religion of Egypt and Arabic is its official language.The great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River, an area of about 40,000 square kilometres (15,000 sq mi), where the only arable land is found. The large regions of the Sahara desert, which constitute most of Egypt's territory, are sparsely inhabited. About 43% of Egypt's residents live across the country's urban areas, with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta.</p>
